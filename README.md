# Traffic_Sign_Recognition
### Traffic Sign Recognition using Machine Learning

This project implements a Traffic Sign Recognition system using machine learning/deep learning techniques. The goal is to automatically classify different traffic signs from images, a key component in autonomous driving and driver-assistance systems.

#### Project Overview
Preprocesses traffic sign images
Trains a model to accurately classify the signs
Uses deep learning (likely CNNs) for feature extraction
Evaluates accuracy and performance
Visualizes training/validation trends

#### Features
Image loading and preprocessing
Data augmentation for better generalization
CNN-based traffic sign classifier
Evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix
Prediction on unseen test samples

#### Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

#### How to Run
Clone the repository
Install dependencies
Run the Jupyter Notebook / script
View output predictions/metrics

#### Dataset
Typically uses the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) or similar dataset (depending on your notebook). Replace with actual dataset if needed.

#### Results
High classification accuracy
Model successfully predicts multiple types of traffic signs
Training & validation curves included

#### License
Free to use for learning and research.
